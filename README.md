# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Digambar Singh 

I'm a passionate software engineer with a diverse skill set. Here's a bit about me:

## Skills

- **C**: I've been working with C for several years. From low-level systems programming to embedded devices, I love the versatility of this language.

- **Python**: Python is my go-to language for web development, data analysis, and automation. I've built web applications, scraped data, and even trained machine learning models using Python.

- **Verilog**: As a hardware enthusiast, I enjoy designing digital circuits using Verilog. I've implemented various projects, including 32-bit adders, multipliers, and memory controllers.

- **Databases**:
    - **MySQL**: I've designed and optimized relational databases using MySQL. From schema design to complex queries, I'm comfortable with it all.
    - **MongoDB**: NoSQL databases intrigue me, and MongoDB is my favorite. I've built scalable applications using its flexible document-based model.

## Projects

Here are some of my notable projects:

1. **Verilog Mini Projects**:
    - 32-bit adder
    - Array multiplier
    - Barrel shifter
    - Binary divider
    - And more!

2. **Image Processing Toolbox in Verilog**:
    - Leveraging Basys3 FPGA, I've implemented image convolution, motion blur, and other image processing techniques.

3. **MIPS Processor in Verilog**:
    - A 5-stage pipelined 32-bit MIPS microprocessor. I've explored computer architecture, instruction sets, and Verilog components.

4. **DDR2 Memory Controller**:
    - Written in Verilog, this controller manages DDR2 memory.

5. **Basic SIMD Processor**:
    - A simple SIMD processor with a 16-bit ALU, implemented in Verilog.
